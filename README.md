# Data Structures

This is a temporary repository containing work done in Data Structures Lab, SY Sem 4 B.Tech Engineering. 

## Singly Linked List - LL_Menu.cpp

A menu driven program to perform basic linked lists commands like: display list, create list, insert at start, middle, end, delete at start, middle, end, reverse list and concatinate lists.

## Doubly Linked List - DLL.cpp

A menu driven program to perform basic doubly linked lists commands like: display list, create list, insert at start, middle, end, delete at start, middle, end, reverse list and concatinate lists.

## Circular Linked List - CLL.cpp

A menu driven program to perform basic circular linked lists commands like: display list, create list, insert at start, middle, end, delete at start, middle, end, reverse list and concatinate lists.

## Trees - Tree.cpp

A menu driven program to create a binary tree and has features to perform recursive & iterative tree traversals: in-order, pre-order & post-order.

## Binary Search Tree - BSTree.cpp

A menu driven program to create a simple binary search tree and basic implementation features such as creating list/nodes, searhcing nodes, delete nodes, in-order traversal, etc.

## Depth First Search - DFS.cpp

A menu driven program to create a simple graph and implementation of depth first search alogrithm on it and to display the output.

## Prim's Alogrithm - Prims_Algo.cpp

A menu driven program to create a simple graph and implementation of Prim's alogrithm on it to to find the minimum cost path of a spanning tree and display the output.

## File Organistaion: Direct Access - Direct.c

A program to create a simple database from user and save it in a file, and then implement direct access method to fetch the contents of the file.

## File Organistaion: Sequential Access - Sequential.c

A program to create a simple database from user and save it in a file, and then implement sequential access method to fetch the contents of the file.
